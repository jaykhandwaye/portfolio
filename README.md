The project is already running in the Replit environment! Here's how to access and work with it:

Access the website: The portfolio website is currently running on port 5000. In Replit, you can access it using the "Webview" panel that should be visible at the top or right side of your Replit interface. If it's not visible, look for a browser/globe icon or "Open Webview" button.

Development workflow:

The workflow named "Start application" is currently running
It automatically serves your application via npm run dev
The website will automatically reload when you make changes to the code
If you want to restart the application:

You can stop and restart the workflow using the controls in the "Workflow" tab
Or you can simply click on the "Run" button at the top of your Replit interface
For local development:

If you want to run this locally outside of Replit, you'd need to:
Clone the repository
Run npm install to install dependencies
Run npm run dev to start the development server
The application is fully functional with all sections displaying correctly, and I've fixed the issues with the Behance icon and other components. You can browse through the different sections of the portfolio website (Home, About, Portfolio, Services, etc.) to see Jay Khandwaye's video editing work.

Would you like me to make any additional improvements or explain any specific part of the codebase in more detail?
