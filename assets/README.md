## Hero Background Video Requirements

Place your video file named `hero-background.mp4` in this directory. For best performance:

- Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or proportional (will be cropped to fit)
- Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop)
- Size: Aim for under 5MB for performance
- Content: Subtle motion that won't distract from text overlay

## Video Optimization Tips

1. Use a video compressor like Handbrake or online tools
2. Remove audio if not needed (our implementation mutes it anyway)
3. Consider a shorter clip that loops well
4. Reduce bitrate for web delivery
